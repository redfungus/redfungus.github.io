I'm a machine learning engineer living in Stockholm. I'm currently working at [Resolution Games](https://www.resolutiongames.com/) focused on Reinforcement Learning in VR games.

Previously, I worked at [Klarna](https://www.klarna.com/) as an ML Engineer. Before that, I worked as a Data Scientist and Android Developer at [Divar](https://divar.ir/).

I obtained my double Master’s degree from KTH and TU/e as part of the EIT Digital Data Science program with a minor in business and entrepreneurship. Prior to that, I completed my bachelor’s degree in Software Engineering at Amirkabir University of Technology.

I'm one of the co-founders of [SpotBot](https://spotbot-dev.slack.com/apps/A013AM33ADB-spotbot?tab=more_info) which is a SlackBot that randomly matches people in channels and gives them fun icebreakers to talk about.
