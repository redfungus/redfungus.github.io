I am Aref Moradi. I am a computer engineer living currently in Stockholm, Sweden. I'm currently working as a Data Engineer at Klarna. I'm interested in using problem solving in every aspect of life to make processes easier.
I'm a co-founder at SpotYet, a event service focused on breaking the ice and increasing meaningful connections.
In my free-time I like to learn new cooking skills and play video games.
