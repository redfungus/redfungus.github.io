I am Aref Moradi. I am a computer engineer living in Stockholm, Sweden. I'm currently working as a Data Engineer at Klarna and finishing my Master's degree at KTH university. I'm doing my Master's as part of the EIT Digital Data Science program with a minor in business.
I'm interested in using problem-solving in every aspect of life to make different processes more efficient. I believe in the cumulative power of efficieny and iteration.
I'm a co-founder at SpotYet, a event service focused on breaking the ice and increasing meaningful connections.
In my free-time I like to learn new cooking skills and play video games.
