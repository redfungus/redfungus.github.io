I'm a machine learning engineer living in Stockholm. I'm currently working at [Resolution Games](https://www.resolutiongames.com/) focused on Reinforcement Learning in VR games.

Previously, I worked at [Klarna](https://www.klarna.com/) as an ML Engineer. Before that, I worked as a Data Scientist and Android Developer at [Divar](https://divar.ir/).

I obtained my Master’s degree from KTH as part of the EIT Digital Data Science program with a minor in business and entrepreneurship. I also obtained my bachelor’s degree in Software Engineering from Amirkabir University of Technology.

I'm one of the co-founders of [SpotBot](https://spotbot-dev.slack.com/apps/A013AM33ADB-spotbot?tab=more_info) which is a SlackBot that randomly matches people in channels and gives them fun icebreakers to talk about.

I'm very interested in Reinforcement Learning and especially it's applications in video games. I'm learning to use game engines and implement RL algorithms in them.

In my free-time I like to go bouldering and read books (non-fiction) also I love to play video games and watch movies.
